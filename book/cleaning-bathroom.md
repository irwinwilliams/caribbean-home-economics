One time, when I was 14, my mom instructed me to clean the bathroom everyday.

# Chapter 1: General
## Don't mix chemicals.
Usually, you can buy a special-purpose chemical for a specific areas. Like the toilet cleaner, or a tile cleaner. 
Or, you can be general purpose. Like bleach.
Avoid mixing bleach with other things. Not avoid, don't. Just don't do it. Bleach is very reactive.

# Chapter 2: Toilets
Toilets are gross, yes, we know, but cleaning if done regularly can be appealing. 
## General toilet cleaning
Assuming you aren't cleaning the toilet everyday, consider the cost of a roll of toilet paper. It's probably not even the cost of a soda. So, don't feel bad to just use toilet paper in sufficient quantity. I usually spray the seat, cover, handle and take and then wipe with the toilet paper.
Everything then flushes down fine.
