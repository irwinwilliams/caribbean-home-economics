# Mopping

Mopping is a thing you do in degrees. Generally, do as little as you can. 
If you have to do more, it's a staged thing.
1. Sweep the area to be mopped. (You may be tempted to skip this if the level of dust is "light", don't, you'll just end up with a dirty mop and you'll take longer anyway).
2. Find the mop (Because sometimes, you forget it in the bathroom, when it should be outside, drying).
3. Clean the mop (Give it a good rinse, in general, rinse until the water is running out of the mop clear.)
4. Determine your detergent

## Detergents
Listen, young people who clean regularly at home probably swear by chlorine-based bleaches. The older you get, you appreciate there are different detergent tools for different jobs. Chlorine bleaches have a smell. Maybe you might go for PineSol, if you're cleaning because you expect guests. You might be cleaning some tiles that have a nice "new-tile" shine. In that case, you should look for something that will preserve that shine. In which case, try vinegar. Maybe that's worse, I dunno. Do some research.
By the time I'm breaking out bleach, it's probably because there's a spill that probably has a smell, looks gross and is sticky. 

5. Having found your detergent, DON'T BE LIBERAL. Use the amount that's recommended for the cleaning you're going after. Might be a few capfuls. 
6. Sometimes, procrastinating helps. 
## Procrastination
When I have a gnarly spot to clean, I see that as an opportunity. I don't start with that spot. I clean around it. The thinking is, the floor doesn't get mopped frequently enough. If I have to mop, I'm going to maximize the experience. For example, I had to mop out some juice that fell and snaked its way across the kitchen and into another room.
Instead of just focusing on the juice, I mopped the whole room. It literally took minutes longer and I got a lot more points from my family.

Home Economics is all about getting points from your family for making great home decisions. Nothing else. 

Maybe that will change when this book is done.
